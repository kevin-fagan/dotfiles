# Dotfiles
Dotfile are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). To ensure Stow works 
correctly, clone this repository into your home directory. The directory structure of each Stow 
package is designed so that Stow knows where to create the appropriate symlinks. If you are 
interested, [here](https://www.jakewiesler.com/blog/managing-dotfiles) is a pretty good article to help you get started.
